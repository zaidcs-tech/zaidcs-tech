### Hi there! 👋

I'm a B.Tech student passionate about **Red Teaming** and **Cybersecurity**.
I have a background in **Sales**, which helps me understand Social Engineering and Risk Reporting.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on: **Python Port Scanner & Active Directory Labs**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: **Network Penetration Testing & Linux Privilege Escalation**
- ⚡ Fun fact: I use my sales experience to study Social Engineering attacks.
